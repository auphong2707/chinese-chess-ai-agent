# Chinese chess AI agent
This is the project about creating a simple AI game engine for Chinese chess

## Overview: How to contribute to this project
First, you need to take a look at the to-do list, each develop branch has a unique to-do list so you need to make sure you are in the correct branch. For each task of the list, you need to create a branch apart from the develop branch (for example: creating a piece branch apart from the game-state branch). After finishing the task, you need to pull a request to merge your branch with the develop-branch and wait for the acceptance. You can do another task at that time.
## Convention of branch name
You need to create the branch name with this convention: **taskcode-tasksubcode-taskname**. In which:
- **taskcode**: This is the code representing the part of the develop branch which the task aims for.
- **tasksubcode**: This is the code representing the feature, bug fix, update,... of the part represented by **taskcode**
- **yourname**: This is the name (alias) of the user who do the task

You can remove unimportant part of the taskname to make the branch name more compact. For example, we have a task: *"1-001: Create generate_admissible_moves method of General"* then the branch name will be: "**1-001-veil**"

## Problem during the process
After you create the name of the branch, you need to solve the problem that the task gives to you. If you have any question about the task or any support, you can ask the team members on the Messenger group, or inbox to the specific member.

## Finishing
After you finish the task, you must **tick the task** in the to-do list then pull a merge request on **Github website** (GitHub desktop don't support pull request). You may need to notify the leader about the request. During the waiting time, you can do another task. If there is any issue with your file, your request will be declined and the leader will tell you why.
